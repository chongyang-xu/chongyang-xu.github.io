I’m fortunate to be immersed in learning the craft of research at [MPI-SWS](https://mpi-sws.org/). I’m equally lucky to work with [Laurent Bindschaedler](https://binds.ch). Before relocating to Saarbrücken, Germany, in June 2022 to join MPI, I briefly worked as a software engineer in China.

My research interests lie in software systems, focusing on graph processing, machine learning systems, and optimizing efficiency and scalability.
