I’m fortunate to learn scientific research at [MPI-SWS](https://mpi-sws.org/). To join MPI, I relocated to Saarbruecken, Germany, in June 2022, following a brief role as a software engineer in China.

I pursue the systems approach: tackling true problems, focusing on real-world implementations, and caring about the overall results.
